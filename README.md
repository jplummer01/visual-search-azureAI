# Visual search with Azure Computer Vision and Azure Cognitive Search


## Visual search with vector embeddings
Vector embeddings are a way of representing content such as text or images as vectors of real numbers in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings are often learned from large amounts of textual and visual data using machine learning algorithms like neural networks. Each dimension of the vector corresponds to a different feature or attribute of the content, such as its semantic meaning, syntactic role, or context in which it commonly appears. By representing content as vectors, we can perform mathematical operations on them to compare their similarity or use them as inputs to machine learning models.

## Business applications
Digital asset management: Image retrieval can be used to manage large collections of digital images, such as in museums, archives, or online galleries. Users can search for images based on visual features and retrieve the images that match their criteria.
Medical image retrieval: Image retrieval can be used in medical imaging to search for images based on their diagnostic features or disease patterns. This can help doctors or researchers to identify similar cases or track disease progression.
Security and surveillance: Image retrieval can be used in security and surveillance systems to search for images based on specific features or patterns, such as in, people & object tracking, or threat detection.
Forensic image retrieval: Image retrieval can be used in forensic investigations to search for images based on their visual content or metadata, such as in cases of cyber-crime.
E-commerce: Image retrieval can be used in online shopping applications to search for similar products based on their features or descriptions or provide recommendations based on previous purchases.
Fashion and design: Image retrieval can be used in fashion and design to search for images based on their visual features, such as color, pattern, or texture. This can help designers or retailers to identify similar products or trends.
